Introduction to Code!
Hello! My name is Steven Branch and I am a 34 year old male born in raised in NYC. Growing up I was always interested by the insides of technological devices, and would spend time taking apart old consoles, televisions or anything that I could get my hands on. It was considered destructive, but it was intreging. 

I never felt confident enough to really put the time into learning more about how these things functioned. It was an incredible fear of failing or being mocked that paralyzed me and prevented me from jumping in and taking a chance. As I have gotten older, I have been working towards pushing myself to challenge myself and learn more about the things that scare me. 

This all came to a head during the covid pandemic. I was thinking about making a career change, as I had been in the restaurant indutry for 13 years, and was looking for something a little bit more stimulating. I had started to lose some of my passion and wanted to transition into a career that could present me with challenges and opporuntity to continuatily learn. 

It was tough at the beginning however, as I didn't have much of an idea on what direction i should go. I had considered staying in customer service (possibly getting into the hotel industry), but concluded that doing. something that was somewhat related to what. I have been doing for years wasnot the direction I wanted to go in. A friend of mine sent a link to a free coding bootcamp. This brought. up memories of wanting to get more involved with computer programming. The only obstacle was myself. As the pandemic has continued, the daily battle of wanting to start something new but being afraid raged on. 

In January, I finally made the decision to just dive in and sign up for classes somewhere. After doing a little bit of research I came across Trilogy. Though therewere many uncertainties in regards to the future, it was then that I commited to the idea of not allowing failure to dictate my future, but allowing myself to accept challenges that could potentially be time consuming and difficult to help shape this unknown and uncertain future. 

Class starts in a couple, weeks and although the pre-work has been very confusing and I have had many moments of wanting to give up, I am excited for this new chapter in my life, and am looking forward to combatting these challenges head on!
